## Description

I started on this project because it needed some fixing on the code since there were many duplicates classes that could turned into one single class, making the
code shorter and easy to see when opening devtools. Throughout editing I was able to learn how to change both css and html without messing up the website and making it look very similar
like nothing has happened.

## Usage

The use of this is when a user goes into the devtools, they'll be able to see that the sections are more organizaed than it was before. By clearing out some uneeded elements on both
HTML and CSS.
